# Gaia Stellar Classification Codes

Direct - use MIST bolometric correction tables and extinction map to derive stellar parameters <br />
Grid - use MIST isochrone grid to derive stellar parameters (i.e. including masses, ages, fitting for extinction) <br />

TGAS cross-matched with KIC and EPIC IDs: <br />
